# MOVS-Robot
### Robot moving on vertical surfaces and its implementation

This repository contains the design and development resources for a robot capable of moving on vertical planes. The project includes embedded software, mechanical design files, and technical documentation required to build and operate the system.

---

## Repository Structure

### Software
Contains firmware and source code for the ESP32 microcontroller.

The software is responsible for:
- Robot control logic
- Communication
- Sensor data processing
- Motors control


### CAD
Contains 3D models and mechanical design files for robot components.  
These parts are intended for manufacturing and 3D printing.


### Datasheets
Contains technical documentation for electronic and mechanical components used in the project, like:
- Sensors
- Motors
- Microcontroller
- Other hardware components
